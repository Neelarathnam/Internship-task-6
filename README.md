# Internship-task-6
This project uses the KNN algorithm to classify data from a CSV file. The data is cleaned, labels are converted to numbers, and values are scaled. The model is tested with different K values to find the best one. A graph shows the accuracy for each K. Finally, the best K is used to check how well the model works.
